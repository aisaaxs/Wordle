# Wordle Game

I created a version of the classic Wordle game using a combination of technologies to ensure a dynamic and engaging user experience. Built with **React.js** for efficient component-based architecture, **Tailwind CSS** for responsive and stylish design, and **JavaScript** for the game logic, this implementation also incorporates an API to validate words and fetch meanings.

## Key features include:

- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Users can interact with a virtual keyboard to guess the hidden word, with real-time feedback on each attempt.
- **Responsive Design**: The game layout adjusts seamlessly across different screen sizes, thanks to Tailwind CSS's utility classes.
- **Real-Time Validation**: Utilizes an external API to verify the validity of guessed words and provide instant feedback.
- **Animated Effects**: CSS animations enhance the visual experience, making the game more engaging.

This implementation ensures a fun and interactive experience for players, combining modern web technologies with a classic game concept.
